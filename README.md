The code contains instructions to upload the dataset and basically is a walkthrough to show how to do a 
standardization of death rates, a linear Kitagawa/Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition 
(although I suggest using the DemoDecomp package by Tim Riffe https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DemoDecomp/index.html)
and an abridged life table using R functions. 
I mixed the code using both tidyverse and base R functions because I´m not a good programmer,
but everything works alright and I believe it is straightforward to understand. 
However, since this article was built in purpose to help students to get familiar with these methods and their logic, 
so questions are welcome :) 

Many thanks to José Manuel Aburto, Tim Riffe and Alyson van Raalte 
for teaching me how to code this and for some of the methods I used here, and to
Daniel Zazueta for his opinions .
